# You Don't Have to do it _Every Day_

_but you still have to do it a lot..._

---

Let me tell you a story...

I was a couple years out of college, and I felt lost. Which was weird because by most accounts, I was a success.
I had a high paying, low stress Software Engineer gig that I'm well aware most people in the world would kill for. But I
couldn't kick the feeling that I wanted to be more.

I have always been a fairly undisciplined person. From what I eat, to how much I exercise, to how I spend my time. I was
always at the mercy of my own motivation and attention span. To this day, it's something I still struggle with, and it's why
the topic of habit building is so important to me.

Like many people, James Clear's _Atomic Habits_ was my first introduction to the magic of habit building. It was the catalyst
for my entire self improvement journey (which is still in its infancy). Soon after I found myself diving head first into the
online world of self improvement, habit tracking apps, and more. If you have been on a similar journey as myself, you may have
run across the mantra of:

> The key to building habits is to do a little bit every day.

This idea runs abound in self improvement circles. This idea is reflected in the design of many of the habit tracking apps that
I have used (and loved). A lot of habit tracking apps are a bit less rigid, and allow you to schedule habits for certain days of the
week, or set up quotas for a certain time period. I find all of these approaches _just_ miss the mark in subtle ways. In this article,
I will walk you through what I believe are the problems with these approaches to habit building, and the habit tracker I have created
so that you can build habits with ease, with a system that works.

## The Problems with _Every Day_ Habits

Let me start off by saying, that the titling of this article is intentionally hyperbolic. There isn't anything
wrong with every day habits in and of themselves. The problems start to arise when you try to make *everything*
an every day habit.

### You Probably Don't Have Enough Time

If you're somebody who has a full time job (yes, students, stay-at-home parents, and others with a full time _responsibility_ count),
you probably are already _incredibly_ busy. Maybe you want to start a business to escape your 9-5. Maybe you want to learn a new language.
Maybe you want to write a fantasy novel. Maybe you want to do all of these, and more! As you continue to tack on things you want to make
into habits, you will reach a certain point where you just don't have enough time to do all of them every day.
